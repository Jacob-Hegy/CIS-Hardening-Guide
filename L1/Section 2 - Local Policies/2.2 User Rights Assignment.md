I like to think of the relationship between user rights and security controls in a bit of an odd way.

Imagine you had a gun in a box. You can reinforce that box as much as you want. You can make it steel, you can surround it with barbed wire, you can drop it to the bottom of the ocean, but if the box is opened then the gun is accessible and useable.

However, imagine that gun had a fingerprint scanner on it. Or what if the gun has no ammo? You could remove the trigger, lock the hammer open, any degree of things you wish to do as long as it still serves the purpose that *you* have for it.

In this hypothetical, the box is the security controls and all the add-ons to the gun are the user rights. The security controls inhibit the attacker's efforts while controlling user rights limits their capabilities should they get in. Or in the case of an insider threat, it prevents that threat from creating a large impact when given access to the dangerous equipment/data/network/etc.

That, to me, is the nature of user rights and why they are so critical when it comes to security. It's not all life or death type stuff, it can be insignificant too. Like maybe you just don't want your employees playing Pac-man on the job, or you'd like them to avoid causing disruptions in the network by trying to fix something themselves. It limits the risk that any given user creates by existing.
