Account lockout goes hand-in-hand with your password policy. If you don't have the most complex passwords, a good lockout policy can help protect against brute force attacks.

However, it can be a careful balancing act. Used in conjunction with constantly changing, long, complex passwords and you could very well create the perfect storm to overwhelm your helpdesk! This is why careful consideration is needed before making any configuration changes for either policy.

Similar to Section 1.1, Section 1.2 will be applied to the Default Domain Policy GPO so that it affects all users in the Active Directory domain.

| Policy | Benefits | Potential Inhibitors | Level of Applicability | Privilege Path in Group Policy Management Editor |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1.2.1 Ensure 'Account lockout duration' is set to '15 or more minute(s)' | Greatly increases the time required to brute force into a workstation | If the duration is too low, normal users might not contact the help desk in the event of a lockout, leading to uncertainty if it was a mistake or an attack + attacker could repeatedly lockout account in a DoS attack | L1 - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use) | Computer Configuration/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Account Policies/Account Lockout Policy |
| 1.2.2 Ensure 'Account lockout threshold' is set to '5 or fewer invalid logon attempt(s), but not 0' | Setting a threshold enables the previous setting, inhibiting brute force attacks | Too low a threshold could result in increased mistaken lockouts + attackers could use lockout to perform a DoS attack | L1 - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use) | Computer Configuration/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Account Policies/Account Lockout Policy |
| 1.2.3 Ensure 'Allow Administrator account lockout' is set to 'Enabled' | Allows the built-in admin account to be subject to any implemented account lockout policies, assisting in securing it against brute force attacks as well | Less chance of a DoS attack given the protected nature of admin credentials, but still runs the risk of accidental lockouts (especially important in critical situations such as security incidents) | L1 - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use) | Computer Configuration/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Account Policies/Account Lockout Policy |
| 1.2.4 Ensure 'Reset account lockout counter after' is set to '15 or more minute(s)' | Supports 1.2.1 to enable a user to reattempt logon | Too high a threshold improves the capability of a DoS attack | L1 - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use) | Computer Configuration/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Account Policies/Account Lockout Policy |
## Implementing the Policies
The policies can be found under Account Lockout Policy along the file path "Computer Configuration/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Account Policies/Account Lockout Policy"

All four policies will have to be configured. Account lockout duration will be set to 20 minutes, Account lockout threshold will be set to 5, Allow Administrator account lockout will be enabled, and Reset account lockout counter after will be set to 20 minutes
