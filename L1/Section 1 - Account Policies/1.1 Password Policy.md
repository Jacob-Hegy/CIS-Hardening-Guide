User passwords are undoubtedly one of the most important aspects to security. A good password helps ensure only authorized access to sensitive resources is permitted.

It is for the benefit of both the end user and the business as a whole that a strict password policy be instated (though the choice of which policies to enforce depends on the business itself as well as the sensitivity of its stored data and the potential risk a compromised account poses).

Given that all users should abide by the password policy based on its upsides, configure section 1.1 settings in the Default Domain Policy GPO as opposed to on a user-by-user/group-by-group basis.

| Policy | Benefits | Potential Inhibitors | Level of Applicability |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Ensure 'Enforce password history' is set to '24 or more password(s)' | Prevents password reuse, decreasing the risk posed by credential stuffing | Users might create similar derivations on the same password over and over again + users writing down passwords to avoid forgetting them | L1 - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use) |
| Ensure 'Maximum password age' is set to '365 or fewer days, but not 0' | Decreases risks posed by credential stuffing + can block out attackers who have potentially already compromised an account | Users might just switch between a set of passwords when required to change, diminishing benefits + users writing down passwords to avoid forgetting them if policy is set for too frequent of changes + little benefit if policy doesn't require changes often enough | L1 - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use) |
| Ensure 'Minimum password age' is set to '1 or more day(s)' | Allows for the usage of a password age constraint to begin with | Failure to enforce could cause large impact on availability and the ability of the workforce to complete their tasks | L1 - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use) |
| Ensure 'Minimum password length' is set to '14 or more character(s)' | Increases the complexity of passwords, thus decreasing the risk posed by brute force attacks (password length should be modified according to business needs) | A lack of proper password complexity requirements could make the increased length a moot point + users using repeat passwords, easy to remember passwords, or writing down passwords to avoid forgetting them + increased overhead in the event of longer passwords causing more false lockouts | L1 - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use) |
| Ensure 'Password must meet complexity requirements' is set to 'Enabled' | Increases the complexity of passwords greatly, drastically decreasing the risk posed by brute force attacks to the point of almost complete mitigation of straight brute force<br>Example Rules:<br>- Must use uppercase, lowercase, a symbol, and a number<br>- Must not use names | Employees forgetting passwords leading to increased overhead + users writing down passwords to avoid forgetting them | L1 - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use) |
| Ensure 'Relax minimum password length limits' is set to 'Enabled'<br>(The minimum threshold of password length can now be raised beyond 14 characters) | Enables greater enforcement of complex passwords | Employees forgetting passwords leading to increased overhead + users writing down passwords to avoid forgetting them (possible solution: introduce the usage of passphrases as opposed to passwords) | L1 - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use) |
| Ensure 'Store passwords using reversible encryption' is set to 'Disabled' | Decreases the risk posed in the event of a data breach as attackers will have a harder time discovering passwords (encrypted passwords might as well be plaintext) | Virtually no downside though configuring on a user-by-user basis can be dangerous | L1 - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use) |
## Implementing the Policies
Given that this is the first set of policies we'll be implementing/verifying, I'm going to include a bit of instructions on how to actually navigate to the Group Policy Management and Group Policy Management Editor interfaces. I'm not going to repeat this part of the explanation for future policies.

To make the above changes, we'll open up the Group Policy Management interface in our AD machine by opening the "Tools" dropdown and selecting "Group Policy Management".

From there, go to "Default Domain Policy", and then navigate to Password Policy along the path "Computer Configuration/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Account Policies/Password Policy".

Most of the recommendations are already in place, we'll just change the minimum password length from 7 characters to 14.

For those of you that are curious, "Minimum password length audit" is a setting that allows the collection of audit logs that trigger in the event of a password being created that is greater than \[or equal to] the minimum password length, but less than the threshold set for the audit. It can be used to gauge how much trouble increasing the minimum password length would be.
